# Structure of this MLflow Project

This MLflow project contains a train.py file that trains a scikit-learn model and uses MLflow Tracking APIs to log the model and its metadata (e.g., hyperparameters and metrics) for later use and reference. train.py operates on the Wine Quality Dataset, which is included in wine-quality.csv.
